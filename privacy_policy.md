# Privacy Policy for SiteStack Chrome Extension

**Effective Date:** [04/16/2025]

Thank you for using SiteStack (the "Extension"), developed by [Ashish Gupta]. This Privacy Policy explains how the Extension handles information.

## 1. Information Handling

SiteStack is designed with your privacy in mind. It operates entirely locally within your browser.

*   **Tab Information:** The Extension accesses the URLs and titles of your open browser tabs. This information is processed **only locally** on your device to identify tabs belonging to the same website or specific configurations (like Salesforce environments) for the purpose of grouping them.
*   **User Settings:** The Extension uses `chrome.storage.local` to save your preferences directly on your computer. This includes whether the automatic organization is enabled and any custom names you assign to tab groups.

## 2. How Information is Used

The information accessed by the Extension is used solely for its core functionality:

*   To analyze tab URLs and titles locally to determine appropriate groupings.
*   To create, manage, and display tab groups using the browser's built-in `tabGroups` functionality.
*   To store your settings (enabled/disabled status, custom group names) locally so they persist between browser sessions.

## 3. Data Storage

All data processed or stored by the Extension, including tab information analysis and user settings, resides **exclusively on your local device**. Settings are saved using the standard `chrome.storage.local` API provided by the browser.

## 4. Data Sharing and Disclosure

**SiteStack does not collect, transmit, store, or share any of your personal data or browsing information.** All operations are performed locally within your browser. We do not have access to your tab information, browsing history, or settings.

## 5. Permissions Justification

SiteStack requires the following permissions solely for local operation:

*   **`tabs`:** To read tab URLs and titles for local grouping logic.
*   **`tabGroups`:** To create and manage the tab groups within your browser.
*   **`storage`:** To save your preferences locally on your device.

## 6. Remote Code

SiteStack does not use or execute any remote code. All functionality is included within the extension package installed from the Chrome Web Store.

## 7. Security

Since all processing occurs locally on your device and no data is transmitted externally, the risk associated with data breaches is minimized.

## 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the Extension's listing or description. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
